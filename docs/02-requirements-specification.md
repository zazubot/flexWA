## 2.4 Use Cases

### UC-001: Send Text Message

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant API as FlexWA API
    participant Engine as WA Engine
    participant WA as WhatsApp

    User->>API: POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/messages/send-text
    API->>API: Validate request
    API->>Engine: sendMessage(chatId, text)
    Engine->>WA: Send via WhatsApp Web
    WA-->>Engine: Message sent
    Engine-->>API: Success response
    API-->>User: 200 OK {messageId}
```

**Actors**: External application, Developer  
**Precondition**: Session is active and connected  
**Main Flow**:

1. User sends a POST request with `chatId` and `text`
2. The system validates the request
3. The system sends the message via the WhatsApp engine
4. The system returns the `messageId`

**Alternative Flow**:

- Session not active → Return 400 error
- Invalid phone number → Return 400 error
- WhatsApp error → Return 500 error

### UC-002: Receive Message via Webhook

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WA as WhatsApp
    participant Engine as WA Engine
    participant API as FlexWA
    participant WH as User Webhook

    WA->>Engine: New message received
    Engine->>API: Message event
    API->>API: Store message
    API->>WH: POST webhook payload
    WH-->>API: 200 OK
    API->>API: Mark delivered
```

**Actors**: WhatsApp, External webhook endpoint  
**Precondition**: Webhook URL configured  
**Main Flow**:

1. WhatsApp sends a message to the session
2. The engine receives and forwards to the API
3. The API stores the message and sends it to the webhook
4. The webhook endpoint acknowledges

**Alternative Flow**:

- Webhook failed → Retry 3x
- All retries failed → Log and mark failed

### UC-003: Create New Session

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Creating: POST /sessions
    Creating --> WaitingQR: Generate QR
    WaitingQR --> Scanning: User scans QR
    WaitingQR --> Timeout: 60s timeout
    Scanning --> Authenticating: QR scanned
    Authenticating --> Ready: Auth success
    Authenticating --> Failed: Auth failed
    Ready --> [*]
    Timeout --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
```
